                <p class="family-contant">The benefit of several years of experience at my law office is that I
                    understand the concerns of families facing numerous obstacles while struggling with divorce and
                    custody matters. That is why I care about quality and not the quantity of work, so my goal with
                    every case I take is to provide excellent service to my clients.

                    <h3>Divorce Lawyers: How Can They Help You?
                    </h3>

                <div class="flex-item-right">
                    <p>Divorce can be a difficult time, with both emotional and legal problems. Many people who go
                        through it find themselves vulnerable and make bad decisions. That is why it is so important to
                        get a lawyer, as an advisor of the whole legal process. They will get to know all the causes for
                        the divorce and the relationship between both parties, so they will be able to look for the best
                        solution.

                    </p>
                    <p>A divorce lawyer works towards the most favourable way for his client to divide the family
                        estate. In some cases, each spouse may separate the property they brought into the marriage,
                        while others may have accumulated assets separately according to an agreement. An attorney can
                        explain whether the estate is a community property estate or an appropriate distribution estate,
                        which can make a drastic difference in the distribution of marital property.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an attorney, I work hard to make this process less traumatic. I provide objective advice to
                        my clients on how the process may affect their future, and I can also serve as an intermediary
                        between spouses if they wish to avoid personal contact to facilitate the process.

                    <p>When both spouses agree to divorce, the process is much easier. Even so, it is advisable to have a lawyer handle the process.</p>

                    <h2>Domestic Violence</h2>
                    <p>Is a fundamental matter in which a lawyer can also help if you need protection for yourself or your children.

                    <p>Receive advice about the properties owned by the couple. A marital agreement might provide a different context if properties were acquired before or after the nuptials.

                    <h2>Marriage Contracts and Prenuptial  and Postnuptial Agreements</h2>
                    <p>The best cure is prevention. A marital agreement, either prenuptial or postnuptial, can prevent many misunderstandings in the couple in the event of divorce. Avoid difficult breakups with a prenuptial agreement.

                    <p>Only a few lawyers are qualified to issue Foreign Divorce Legal Opinion letters. I provide that service, which is necessary to prove that you have been divorced in a foreign country (or Canada, after being married in another country).

                    <p>Refers to the obligation of a person to provide financial support to their spouse after separation or divorce. This support is given when one spouse is financially dependent on the other or has custody of the children.

                    <p>Before signing any legal agreement regarding marriage or family, it is recommended for the signatory to seek independent legal advice. A marital agreement affects the signatories in the event of divorce, so they should consider what the best deal is.</p>

                    <p> If there are significant problems with the divorce and you need a temporary restraining order or protective order, you will need a specialized attorney. I provide that service if you consider yourself in danger because of the divorce.

                    <h2>Cohabitation Agreements</h2>
                    <p>May seem unromantic, but they will prevent many relationship problems. Agreeing on the rules of cohabitation is much safer when done in front of a lawyer. With this agreement, the partners can decide how to act in case of any personal or financial problems.</p>
